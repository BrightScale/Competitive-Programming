# Competitive-Programming-1
All my programming files in the "Alpha Star" project on Eclipse. Most of them are for USACO. Some of them are blank or only get partials. Date updated: Feb 19 2020

So basically these are all my files currently for USACO problems. I believe it contians 50% Gold, 40% Platinum, 7% Silver, 3% Bronze.
Please don't use this for your homework! Just try to understand it (I know it is hard) For now all of them are in Java.
